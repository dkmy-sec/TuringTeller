# TuringTeller

TuringTeller is a Flask-based web application designed to administer a reverse Turing test. It evaluates a respondent's ability to display human-like understanding and responses through a series of cognitive and emotional tests. This application can be used for educational purposes, cognitive studies, or simply for fun to see if one can demonstrate the complexity and nuances of human thought processes in an interactive format.

## Features

- **Interactive Tests**: Ten unique tests covering aspects like sarcasm recognition, emotional resonance, humor, intuition, and more.
- **Web-based Interface**: Easily accessible via any web browser.
